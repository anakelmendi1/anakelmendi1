# Hello, I'm Ana Kelmendi! ðŸ‘‹

Originally from Kosovo, I discovered my interest in computers rather later in life. This realization transformed the way I view technology and its potential to solve real-world problems. 

## ðŸŒŸ My Journey

Although I didnâ€™t start with a background in programming or technology, my family's involvement in IT profoundly influenced my career path. Watching them solve complex problems and innovate solutions showed me the power of technology. This realization led me to the University of Illinois Chicago with a major in CS.

## ðŸ’¡ Projects & Innovation

- Tic-Tac-Toe Game: Using C++, I crafted a game that challenges players and tests strategic thinking, focusing on clean, maintainable code and user-friendly design.

- Food Web Project: This project allowed me to explore more than just code; it was about creating a balanced ecosystem with C, demonstrating my ability to manage both the technical and conceptual aspects of software development.

## ðŸŒ± Growing Every Day

I'm excited about the possibilities in AI and machine learning, areas I'm exploring through coursework and on my own. I aim to develop solutions that are technically sound and ethically designed to enhance user experiences.

Currently, I'm seeking internships in Chicago to apply my programming skills and innovative ideas in a team that values practical, forward-thinking approaches.
